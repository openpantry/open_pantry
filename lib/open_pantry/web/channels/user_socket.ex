  # Socket params are passed from the client and can
  # be used to verify and authenticate a user. After
  # verification, you can put default assigns into
  # the socket that will be set for all channels, ie
  #
  #     {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, verified_user_id)}
  #
  # To deny connection, return `:error`.
  #
  # See `Phoenix.Token` documentation for examples in
  # performing token verification on connect.

  #
  # Would allow you to broadcast a "disconnect" event and terminate
  # all active sockets and channels for a given user:
  #
  #     OpenPantry.Endpoint.broadcast("users_socket:#{user.id}", "disconnect", %{})
  #
  # Returning `nil` makes this socket anonymous.
